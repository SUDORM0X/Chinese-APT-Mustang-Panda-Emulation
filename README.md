# Chinese-APT-Mustang-Panda-Emulation
This is a simulation of an attack carried out by the APT group (Mustang Panda), targeting government entities in Southeast Asia. The attack campaign was active from late September 2023. The attack chain begins with the abuse of Visual Studio Code's reverse shell to execute arbitrary code and deploy additional payloads.
